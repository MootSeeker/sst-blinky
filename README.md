Blink a LED with Super-Simple Tasker (SST) a preemptive, priority-based RTOS kernel

Tried the example project from @QuantumLeaps git repository [Super-Simple-Tasker](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/Super-Simple-Tasker)

Implemented his example into a STM32Cube project and add it into drivers folder.
